# Why Vecia: From Frustration to Automation

I was doing the same task 200 times a month.

Copy. Paste. Check. Validate.

In a large company, these processes exist for a reason: when amounts pile up to millions, rigor is non-negotiable.

But my brain? It only saw one thing: endless repetition.

## The trigger

So I started automating.

Mini-scripts. VBA. Hacks.

Nothing glamorous. Just bits of code doing the work for me while I drank my coffee.

Then ChatGPT happened.

And suddenly, I could code real projects. Not just janky Excel macros, but tools that actually worked.

---

## The first project

The first one? A Discord bot that reminded me every 25 minutes to take a break, move, come back focused.

Nothing fancy. But it worked.

I shared. Helped people around me. Met Tanguy.

Tanguy came from the French Ministry of Defense. AI and security. The kind of guy who doesn't do things halfway.

## The revelation

And we figured out something important:

**People want to save time.**
**But they don't want to learn 15 new tools.**

That's where 90% of AI projects fail. Not because the technology doesn't work. But because you're asking people to completely change how they work.

Real AI adoption isn't a revolution.
It's an evolution.

## The Vecia philosophy

Take what already exists.
Add a layer of intelligence.
Let people work like before — just faster.

That's Vecia.

No grand speeches about digital transformation. No $1000/day consulting to explain what you already know.

Just automations that work. Integrated into your existing tools. Delivered in weeks, not months.

## For you

If you're already automating stuff on your own, even small scripts, you're ahead of 90% of companies.

Keep going.

*What's the first thing you ever automated? Or if not — what was the first question you remember asking ChatGPT?*
