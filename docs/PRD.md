  - **Why Astro**: Component-based architecture, excellent performance, native multi-language support
  - **Output**: Static HTML (no server required)
  - **Deployment**: Vercel (vecia.fr domain)

#### Styling & Interactivity

  - Custom theme matching graphic_chart.md colors
  - Responsive design system
- **Alpine.js v3.x** - Lightweight JavaScript for interactions
  - Tabs, carousels, mobile menu, language switcher
  - No build step required, works with Astro

#### Hero Particle Animation
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Custom particle system from V3
  - Canvas-based animation
  - No external library dependencies
  - Extracted from current working implementation

#### Multi-Language Architecture (CRITICAL)

**Strategy: Single Source, Multi-Language**

```
Principle: Components (shared) + Translations (separate)
```

**File Structure:**
```
src/
├── components/          # SHARED across FR/EN (write once)
│   ├── Hero.astro
│   ├── AITabs.astro
│   └── ServiceCards.astro
├── layouts/
│   └── BaseLayout.astro # Shared layout
├── pages/
│   ├── index.astro     # French (no /fr/ prefix)
│   ├── about.astro
│   ├── blog.html
│   └── en/             # English versions
│       ├── index.astro
│       └── about.astro
├── i18n/
│   ├── ui.ts           # All UI strings { fr: {...}, en: {...} }
│   ├── pricing.ts      # Dynamic pricing with IP detection
│   └── utils.ts        # Helper functions (useTranslations, etc.)
└── lib/
    └── particles/      # Hero particle system
```

**Astro i18n Configuration:**
```javascript
// astro.config.mjs
export default defineConfig({
  i18n: {
    locales: ['fr', 'en'],
    defaultLocale: 'fr',
    routing: {
      prefixDefaultLocale: false  // FR at root, EN at /en/
    }
  }
});
```

**Translation System:**
- All text in TypeScript files (`ui.ts`)
- Type-safe translation keys
- French complete, English to be translated
- Components reference keys, not hardcoded text

**Workflow:**
- Change design/layout → Edit ONE Astro component → Both languages update
- Change French text → Edit `ui.ts` French object → English untouched
- Change English text → Edit `ui.ts` English object → French untouched

#### Dynamic Pricing (IP-Based Currency)

**Requirements:**
- Detect user country via IP
- Display appropriate currency (EUR/CHF/AED/USD)
- Allow manual override (localStorage/cookie)

**Implementation:**
```
Country Detection:
- Switzerland (CH) → CHF
- UAE (AE) → AED
- Europe (FR, BE, DE, IT, ES, etc.) → EUR
- Others → USD (fallback)

Detection Method:
- Vercel: request.headers.get('x-vercel-ip-country')
- Cloudflare: request.headers.get('cf-ipcountry')
```

**Pricing Tiers:**
```
Package              EUR      CHF      AED      USD
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Victoire Rapide    €1,900  CHF 1,850  AED 8,000  $2,100
Transformation     €4,500  CHF 4,400  AED 19,000 $4,900
Accélération       €9,000  CHF 8,800  AED 38,000 $9,900
```

#### Content Management
- **Markdown Files** for blog articles
- **Astro Content Collections** for type-safe content
- **Git-based workflow** (no separate CMS initially)
- **Future**: Decap CMS if needed (Phase 2)

#### Blog → LinkedIn Integration

**MVP Approach (Manual with Template Generator):**

1. Write blog article in Markdown with LinkedIn metadata:
```yaml
---
title: "Article Title"
publishDate: 2025-01-20
linkedin:
  caption: |
    🚀 Custom LinkedIn caption
    Key points...
  hashtags: ["AI", "Automation", "Business"]
---
```

2. Run script to generate LinkedIn post template:
```bash
npm run linkedin:generate article-slug
# Outputs ready-to-paste caption + URL + hashtags
```

3. Manually copy/paste to LinkedIn

**Future Options:**
- Semi-automated: Browser automation to pre-fill LinkedIn composer
- Fully automated: LinkedIn API integration (Phase 3)

#### Lead Capture & Email Tools
- **Email Capture Forms**: Custom Astro components
- **Email Storage**: Initially CSV/Google Sheets, then ConvertKit/Mailchimp
- **Popups**: Custom Alpine.js components (no external library for MVP)
- **Future**: Sumo or similar (Phase 2)

#### Analytics Stack
- **Plausible Analytics** - Privacy-first metrics
- **Microsoft Clarity** - Free heat mapping
- **LinkedIn Insight Tag** - B2B tracking
- **Facebook Pixel** - Audience insights (optional)

### 7.2 Performance Requirements
- Lighthouse score > 90 for all metrics
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- Time to Interactive < 3 seconds
- Cumulative Layout Shift < 0.1
