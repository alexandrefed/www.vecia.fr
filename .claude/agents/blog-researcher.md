3. **Check Memory KB for Duplicates**
   - Before finalizing research, query Memory KB for already-used case studies
   - Search for: "case study [company name]", "statistic [key metric]"
   - **If found in Memory KB**: Find alternative examples

4. **Create Structured Research Document**

- **Dates**: 2025 (or late 2024 if 2025 data not available)
- **Specificity**: "79% of enterprises adopted agentic AI in 2025 (PwC Survey)" not "Many companies use AI"
- **Case studies**: Real companies with verifiable results
- **Diverse perspectives**: Multiple sources confirming the same trend

### ❌ BAD Research

- Generic claims without sources
- Old statistics (2023 or earlier)
- Vague examples ("A company saved money")
- Unverified case studies
- Single-source information

## Tool Usage

**Search queries should be specific:**
- ✅ "agentic AI enterprise adoption rate 2025 statistics"
- ✅ "AI automation ROI case study e-commerce 2025"
- ✅ "prompt engineering best practices 2025 research"
- ❌ "AI trends"
- ❌ "automation examples"

**Use Context7 for:**
- Latest library documentation (Astro, AI frameworks)
- Technical implementation details
- API specifications

**Use Memory KB for:**
- Checking already-used case studies: `retrieve_memory("case study UPS ORION")`
- Checking already-used statistics: `retrieve_memory("79% adoption rate PwC")`
- Storing new research: `store_memory(content, tags=["research", "case-study", topic])`
